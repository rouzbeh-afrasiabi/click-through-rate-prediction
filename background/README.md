# Click-Through Rate

 ## Project Overview
 
Click-through rate is an indicator that shows how lickely your advertisement will be noticed and clicked on by visitors of a website. The main aim of the current project is to predict click through rate based on a dataset containing various features related to user interaction with ads. The data has been anonymized, with the websites where the advertisement was shown and the brand it belonged to have been replaced by other values. The project has been broken down into multiple jupyter notebooks for simplycity. 

## Problem Statement
Due to the low likelyhood of a vistor to click an advertisement the dataset utilized here is imbalanced, meaning that one group in the dataset is present with much higher number of records.
